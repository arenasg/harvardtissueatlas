summary: The Tuberculosis Granuloma Atlas aims to transform our understanding of TB granulomas by using spatially resolved profiling methods that reveal bacterial, lung and immune cell organization, states, and communication within granulomas of different types.

The Tuberculosis Granuloma Atlas aims to understand the biology of granulomas, sites of chronic lung inflammation shaped by the biology *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (*Mtb*) and host immune responses. Within a granuloma, Mtb growth is often limited, but this provides a niche from which bacteria can subsequently disseminate. The project also aims to build capacity for digital pathology in low and middle income countries (LIMC) including the eventual deployment of Atlas viewers and analysis modules on cell phones.  As part of the Atlas, LSP investigators are assembling a cloud-based *Tuberculosis Data Resource* that will consolidate a rich collection of imaging and genomic data on TB granulomas and make the data publicly available.

## Funding
The Atlas is part of a sustained effort by the [Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/) to understand and ultimately eradicate TB (Funded by Grant INV-027106) and NIH 1R01-AI166305.
