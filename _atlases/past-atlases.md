## Ludwig Tumor Atlas
{% include enlarge-image.html src='data-cards/combination-therapy-in-ovarian-cancer.jpg' float='right' alt='' %}

The Ludwig Tumor Atlas was a collaborative project involving US and European research laboratories that are part of Ludwig Cancer Research Centers and Branches and involves several types of solid cancer. Research at HMS is performed under the auspices of the [Ludwig Center at Harvard Medical School](https://ludwigcenter.hms.harvard.edu/). The overall aim of the Atlas was to investigate the molecular basis of intrinsic and acquired resistance to anti-cancer drugs and to develop disease management strategies and therapies that overcome or avoid such resistance. A full description of the projects, data, and publications related to the Ludwig Tumor Atlas can be viewed at the [Ludwig Tumor Atlas](https://www.ludwigtumoratlas.org/) website.

### Key questions
* What are the relative roles of changes in the tumor microenvironment and cancer cells themselves in generating drug resistance?
* Are drug resistant states (and mutations) present prior to the initiation of therapy or are they induced by therapy?
* Are mechanisms that cause tumors to exhibit intrinsic resistance (drug insensitivity) similar to the mechanisms that make initially sensitive tumors drug resistant (acquired drug resistance)
* Which among these mechanisms might be targettable using new or existing drugs?

### Funding
The Ludwig Tumor Atlas was funded by the [Ludwig Center at Harvard Medical School](https://ludwigcenter.hms.harvard.edu/) and by a generous gift from the [Ludwig Cancer Research Foundation](http://www.ludwigcancerresearch.org/).

## The Omic and Multidimensional Spatial Atlas
{% include enlarge-image.html src='graphics/OMS-atlas.png' float='right' alt='' %}

The Omic and Multidimensional Spatial (OMS) Atlas Center based at the Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU) and led by [Joe Gray](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/gray-lab) was a component of the National Cancer Institute [Human Tumor Atlas Network](https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative/implementation/human-tumor-atlas) (HTAN), a multi-center program within the National Cancer Institute that emerged from the [Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot Initiative](https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative).

### Key questions
The OMS was focused on elucidating mechanisms of therapy resistance in three clinical scenarios in which disease recurrence is a major concern:
(a) hormone-receptor positive breast cancer (HRBC) undergoing treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy, (b) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) undergoing treatment with a PARP inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent (c) castration resistance prostate cancer (CRPC) undergoing treatment with enzalutamide. Diverse imaging and omic methods were applied to this analysis including several complementary ways to create spatial maps of cell types and states. These include multiplex immuno-histochemistry, CyCIF, Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscope (FIB-SEM).

### Funding
The OMS Center at Harvard Medical School was funded by a [Human Tumor Atlas Network](https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative/implementation/human-tumor-atlas) grant U2C-CA233280 (Joe Gray PI) from the National Cancer Institute "**Omic and Multidimensional Spatial (OMS) Atlas**".
