    We develop high-plex quantitative methods that provide subcellular spatial data about the complex biological interactions that occur within tissues. Our methods enable next-generation breakthroughs in precision medicine, such as AI-assisted predictive models, early detection of cancer, and precision approaches to treating disease.

    Much of our work relies on the cyclic immunofluorescence (CyCIF) method, which generates high-plex tissue images using multiple cycles of staining, imaging, and bleaching. More recently, we developed the Orion method, which collects rapid, one-shot 18-channel immunofluorescence images and clinical-grade H&E images of the same slide.
