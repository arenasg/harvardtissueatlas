# Talks
## Profiling of the Tumor Microenvironment to Improve Diagnosis and Therapy
This webinar presents two projects from the Ludwig Centers at Harvard and MIT that are part of the Ludwig Tumor Atlas Project. The Ludwig Tumor Atlas applies diverse technologies to probe the tumor environment using a variety of methods, including highly multiplexed tissue imaging, dissociative single cell sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and conventional histology.
