# Talks
## Understanding and Personalizing Immunotherapy Through Single-cell Analysis
Ben Izar, MD, PhD, Medical Oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, talks about how multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging using t-CyCIF is revealing the architecture of tumors and the many types of cells involved. t-CyCIF (Tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence) can be used to quantify signal transduction cascades, measure the levels of tumor antigens and determine immunophenotypes using immune cell lineage markers. t-CyCIF is a powerful tool to study drug resistance of immunotherapy in different patients.
