# Private Data
Ongoing projects are typically associated with additional software resources that are available to project participants only (by invitation). These resources involve identity and data management via [Sage Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/), and cloud-deployed instance of the [OME OMERO database](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero/), and access to the HTA deployment of [MCMICRO](https://mcmicro.org/). Note that all of these resources are either open source or generally available, making it straightforward for others to employ similar resources.

Read about the HTA's approach to data sharing on the [Data overview](/data-Overview) page. 

## Private Data Portal Access for HTA Collaborators
HTA collaborators will receive access to the Atlas Synapse group when data becomes available to share. If you have not yet received access, please request access following the Private Data Portal link associated with your Atlas project.
