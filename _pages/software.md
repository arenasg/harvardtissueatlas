  At the [Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology](https://labsyspharm.org/), we pair innovative methods for data collection with cutting-edge computational methods and software. We are engaged in a variety of open-source software projects for the analysis, visualization, and quality control of highly multiplexed whole slide images.

  Our largest software projects are **MCMICRO**, an end-to-end pipeline for transforming images into quantitative single-cell feature data, and **Minerva**, a suite of lightweight tools for interactive viewing and fast sharing of multiplexed image data. Ongoing projects enable intuitive interaction with imaging data, facilitate multimodal data integration, and harness AI/ML for analyzing and interpreting image features.
