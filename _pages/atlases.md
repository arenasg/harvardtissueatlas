The Harvard Tissue Atlas (HTA) gathers image and -omic datasets into high-resolution molecular maps. Our atlases provide precise molecular data on cell types, states, and interactions in a preserved 3D environment, shedding light on the complex interactions between cellular and acellular structures in normal and diseased tissue. These data enable a deeper understanding of how diseases start and progress to improve how diseases are diagnosed and managed. 

The Harvard Tissue Atlas datasets provide a foundation for future advances in precision medicine, such as early cancer detection, AI/ML predictive models, and disease stratification for clinical trials.
