Many HTA projects have not yet been gathered together into larger Atlases. Access to data from these projects can be found under the “Data” tab, typically organized by the manuscript in which they were first described. Ongoing projects are typically associated with additional software resources that are available to project participants only (by invitation). These resources involve identity and data management via [Sage Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/), and cloud-deployed instance of the [OME OMERO](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/) database, and access to the HTA deployment of [MCMICRO](https://mcmicro.org/). Note that all of these resources are either open source or generally available, making it straightforward for others to similar resources.
