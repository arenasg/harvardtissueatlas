The Harvard Tissue Atlas (HTA) gathers together multiple research projects into collections of single-cell data “atlases” that contain data from normal and diseased tissues from humans and animal models, with a particular emphasis on cancer. The goal of these atlases is to describe the myriad of interactions that occur between cells and acellular structures within tissues by combining image and omic datasets into molecular and physical maps. Many HTA projects are currently organized by the manuscript in which they were first described, but will be gathered together into larger Atlases soon.
