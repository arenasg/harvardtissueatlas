# FAQ

## Do you need to be at Harvard to be part of the HTA?
No! The HTA is hosted at Harvard Medical School but participating research teams come from across the globe. The resources and methods developed by the HTA are available to the entire scientific community.
## Can new teams and individuals join the HTA?
Yes. Students, postdocs and clinical fellows, as well as individuals interested in technical and research positions, should contact HiTS@harvard.edu. The HTA is also open to participation by research groups in academe, government and industry, but the HTA is entirely funded by external research grants (sponsored research). Thus, the normal route to joining the HTA is to develop a new collaborative research proposal.
## Can industry join the HTA?
We actively encourage companies developing new technologies and instruments for spatial tissue profiling to contact us. We are always interested in testing out new methods and long-term projects can been funded with STTR/SBIR grants. We are particularly interested in research projects with biotech and pharmaceutical companies involved in early stage clinical trials that involve biopsies. Spatial profiling can provide deep and previously inaccessible information on therapeutic mechanism and trial design. Note that all collaborations with the HTA involve the usual commitment to scientific publication and eventual release of all data and methods.
