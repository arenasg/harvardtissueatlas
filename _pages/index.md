  Tissue and tumor atlases provide precise molecular data on cell types, states, and interactions in a preserved 3D environment to revolutionize our understanding of disease progression and therapeutic response. This will improve diagnosis and disease management.

# Navigating Spatial Biology

The Harvard Tissue Atlas (HTA) gathers together multiple research projects into collections of single-cell data “atlases” that contain data from normal and diseased tissues from humans and animal models, with a particular emphasis on cancer. The goal of these atlases is to describe the myriad of interactions that occur between cells and acellular structures within tissues by combining image and omic datasets into molecular and physical maps. Such tissue atlases will advance our understanding of disease initiation and progression and help develop a new generation of diagnostic molecular tests. Such tests are needed for disease stratification in clinical trials and precision medicine for patients.
