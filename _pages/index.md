  Tissue and tumor atlases revolutionize our understanding of disease progression and therapeutic response. They provide precise molecular data on cell types, states, and interactions in a preserved 3D environment to improve diagnosis and disease management.

# Navigating Spatial Biology

The Harvard Tissue Atlas (HTA) gathers together image and omic datasets into molecular maps. Our atlases bring together multiple research projects examining normal and diseased tissue from human and animal models, with an emphasis on cancer. The goal of these atlases is to describe the myriad of interactions that occur between cells and acellular structures within tissues to advance our understanding of disease initiation and progression. This will help develop a new generation of diagnostic molecular tests, which are needed for disease stratification in clinical trials and precision medicine for patients.
