# summary of the tool
description: |
  CyLinter is quality control software for multiplexed microscopy images that identifies and removes single cell data that has been corrupted by artifacts. Artifacts can result from optical aberrations (e.g., from contaminating lint or hair on the sample) or image-processing errors (e.g., errors in single cell segmentation) and can confound downstream analyses. CyLinter guides users through the process of removing noisy data in an interactive, visual environment and improves the quality of the resulting single cell data.
