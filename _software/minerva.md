title: Minerva
# summary of the tool
description: Minerva is a suite of lightweight software tools that enables interactive viewing and fast sharing of large image data. With **Minerva Author**, users can import an image and generate a multi-waypoint, annotated **Minerva Story** that walks viewers through their data. Minerva Stories are hosted on the web and viewed through a web browser (no download required!), making them ideal for sharing large-scale image data as part of tissue atlases.
