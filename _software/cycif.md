# summary of the tool
description: |
  CyCIF (cyclic immunofluorescence) is a robust and inexpensive method for highly multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging using standard instruments and reagents. t-CyCIF generates multiplexed images of fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples using an iterative process in which conventional low-plex fluorescence images are repeatedly collected from the same sample and then assembled into a high dimensional representation. Highly multiplexed images of intact tumor architecture can be used to quantify signal transduction cascades, measure the levels of tumor antigens, determine precise immune phenotypes, and more.
