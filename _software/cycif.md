# summary of the tool
description: |
  CyCIF (cyclic immunofluorescence) is a robust, inexpensive method for highly multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging of human tissue samples. CyCIF generates multiplexed images using an iterative process in which low-plex fluorescence images are repeatedly collected from the same sample and  assembled into a high-dimensional mosaic image. High-plex images of tumors can be used to quantify signal transduction cascades, measure the levels of tumor antigens, determine precise immune phenotypes, and more.
