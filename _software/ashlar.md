# summary of the tool
description: ASHLAR (Alignment by Simultaneous Harmonization of Layer/Adjacency Registration) is an open-source Python tool that combines multi-tile microscopy images into high-dimensional mosaic images. For multi-cycle imaging methods (like CyCIF), ASHLAR also aligns images from different cycles with a high level of accuracy. ASHLAR can be used with virtually any unstitched microscope image file and multiplexed imaging method.
