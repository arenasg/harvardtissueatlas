description: |
    Identifying single cells within tissue images, a process known as segmentation, is critical for single-cell analysis of imaging data. UnMICST (Universal Models for Identifying Cells and Segmenting Tissue) is a semantic segmentation method for tissue images. UnMICST uses a convolutional neural network to generate probability maps that classify whether a given pixel belongs to the foreground or background class. UnMICST was trained using images of real human tissue, including real augmentations (e.g., out-of-focus images) and nuclear envelope stains, to improve segmentation accuracy across a wide range of tissue types. The latest version of UnMICST is part of the [MCMICRO pipeline](https://mcmicro.org/).
