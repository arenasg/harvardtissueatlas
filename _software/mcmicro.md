title: Multiple-choice microscopy pipeline (MCMICRO)
# summary of the tool
description: MCMICRO is an open-source processing pipeline for multiplexed whole-tissue images and tissue microarrays. It consists of customizable modules that sequentially perform image processing and quantification steps, including stitching, registration, cell segmentation, single-cell quantification, and visualization. Each module is containerized with Docker, making it possible to deploy MCMICRO acrossÂ various computing environments, including local machines, job-scheduling clusters, and cloud environments like AWS. MCMICRO is undergoing active development, and modules are regularly added and improved as part of the growing MCMICRO community.
