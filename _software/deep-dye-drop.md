title: Deep Dye Drop
# summary of the tool
description: |
  The Dye Drop assay is a versatile, low-cost, multiplexed microscopy method for obtaining detailed single-cell viability and cell cycle data. The Dye Drop method uses a set of incrementally more dense solutions to prevent cell loss and improve the consistency of cell perturbation experiments. Dye Drop can also be combined with CyCIF to yield further molecular and spatial information. The method is paired with computational analysis tools that calculate cell state and growth rate metrics from the high throughput data.
