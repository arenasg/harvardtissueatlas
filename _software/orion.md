# summary of the tool
description: |
  Orion is a method for collecting one-shot 18-plex immunofluorescence images and diagnostic-grade H&E images from the same samples. The Orion method was developed in collaboration with RareCyte Inc. and uses a specialized microscope and fluorescent antibodies (known as ArgoFluorsâ„¢), which can be imaged simultaneously and spectrally unmixed. We show that same-slide H&E and IF images provide complementary information that can be used to train ML models that effectively predict cancer progression.
