Peter Sorger, PhD is co-director of the Harvard Tissue Atlas and founding director of the [Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology](https://labsyspharm.org/)Â (LSP), where most of the HTA is based. The focus of his research is on understanding the signal transduction and cell survival networks whose mutation causes cancer and determines responsiveness to therapy. His group combines experimental and computational biology to study cultured cells, animal models, and human specimens with a particular focus on cell-intrinsic and extrinsic oncogenic mechanisms. His group also works to advance the interpretation and stratification of human clinical trial results. As part of the HTA, Peter works to link new data collection methods with the development of algorithms and computational pipelines for interpreting the resulting multi-modal single cell data.
