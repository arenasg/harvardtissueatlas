Joan Brugge is Co-Director of the Ludwig Center at Harvard where she leads an effort to understand the mechanisms by which tumor cells escape cancer therapy. This research aims to develop new treatment approaches that can prevent or overcome acquired drug resistance. Joan is known for her work on the fundamental mechanisms of cancer growth and progression in breast, ovarian, and other cancer types. As part of the HTA, the [Brugge lab](https://brugge.med.harvard.edu/] is focusing on improving understanding of breast cancer in women at high risk due to inherited genetic alterations using single cell methods such as CyCIF to deeply profile human and mouse mammary tissues.
