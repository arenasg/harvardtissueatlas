The [Izar Laboratory](https://www.cancer.columbia.edu/research/laboratories/izar-lab)  investigates interactions between cancer and immune cells during tumor development, metastasis and drug resistance using high-dimensional functional single-cell genomics and imaging. The ultimate goal of this work is to inform better selection and development of therapies to improve the lives of cancer patients.
