    title: Cell state dependent effects of Bmal1 on melanoma immunity and tumorigenicity
    journal: 'Nature Communications. 2024 Jan 20, 15(1):633. PMID: [38245503](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38245503/)'

    description: 'The circadian clock regulator Bmal1 modulates tumorigenesis, but its reported effects are inconsistent. Here, we show that Bmal1 has a context-dependent role in mouse melanoma tumor growth. Loss of Bmal1 in YUMM2.1 or B16-F10 melanoma cells eliminates clock function and diminishes hypoxic gene expression and tumorigenesis, which could be rescued by ectopic expression of HIF1Î± in YUMM2.1 cells. By contrast, over-expressed wild-type or a transcriptionally inactive mutant Bmal1 non-canonically sequester myosin heavy chain 9 (Myh9) to increase MRTF-SRF activity and AP-1 transcriptional signature, and shift YUMM2.1 cells from a Sox10-high to a Sox9-high immune resistant, mesenchymal cell state that is found in human melanomas. Our work describes a link between Bmal1, Myh9, mouse melanoma cell plasticity, and tumor immunity. This connection may underlie cancer therapeutic resistance and underpin the link between the circadian clock, MRTF-SRF and the cytoskeleton.'
